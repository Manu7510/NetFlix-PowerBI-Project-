This Power BI project demonstrates how data visualization can effectively uncover patterns and trends in large entertainment datasets. By analyzing Netflixâ€™s content catalog, the project highlights key metrics such as content distribution by genre, yearly release trends, runtime analysis, and production origins.

The use of Power Query for cleaning, DAX for calculations, and interactive visuals like bar charts, line graphs, maps, and donut charts helped bring valuable insights to life. The project also emphasizes the importance of thoughtful UI/UX design by aligning the dashboard theme with Netflix's brand identity.

Overall, this project showcases how Business Intelligence tools like Power BI can transform raw data into meaningful stories that support better decision-making and user understanding.
